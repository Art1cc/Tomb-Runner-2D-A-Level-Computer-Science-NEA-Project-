# Tomb-Runner-2D-A-Level-Computer-Science-NEA-Project-
This is a WPF application, programmed in C# and Visual Studio that is based off of the game 'Tomb of the Mask'. It is a 2D maze game that revolves around a player controlled character that navigates through a procedurally generated maze, while avoiding obstacles and enemies. The maze is created using a recursive backtracking algorithm. 

Features:
.Procedural maze generation
.Smooth character movement by using DispatcherTimer. 
.Collision detection
.Boundary handling

it is to be noted that this project is NOT FINISHED! Deadline for submission is April 2026. There are still a vast amount of features I have yet to implement into the game.
